            <p class='backgroundContentHeader'>Background</p>
            <p class='backgroundContent'>I began exploration of college basketball statistics around five years ago when 
                I was copying tables from <a class="in-text-link" href='https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/'>Basketball-Reference
                </a> into Excel. I was using macros to reformat the data and designing my own algorithms to analyze a team's 
                strength. My first algorithm correctly predicted the result of 29 of the 32 first round games in 2016's March 
                Madness tournament and I was immediately hooked, not only on the basketball statistics but on the analysis itself.</p>
            <p class='backgroundContent'>Since then, my knowledge of data analysis tools and principles has expanded extensively 
                and, with that, my methods have changed significantly. Currently, I am using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to 
                clean and organize the data before using Python to run the data through algorithms. Finally, I am using 
                Matplotlib to visualize the results with a primary focus on the correlations between my algorithms and a 
                team's win percentage.</p>
            
            <p class='backgroundContentHeader'>Algorithm</p>
            <p class='backgroundContent'>While I examine the correlation of many variables with win percentage, my primary 
                interest in the exploration of these statistics is the development of my own algorithm. Seventy-seven percent 
                of the variation in win percentage for this season is explained through this algorithm, placing it at the same 
                level as more established metrics.</p>
            
            <p class='backgroundContentHeader'>Considerations</p>
            <p class='backgroundContent'>Due to Covid-19, many teams elected to either not play a basketball season, or to play 
                an abbreviated schedule. This leads to larger than average variation in the number of games played and was the 
                key factor in my decision to use win percentage rather than wins for correlations. A total of nine teams were 
                dropped completely from the dataset because they did not play in any games this season.</p>
            <p class='backgroundContent'>As of now, all data is sourced through csv files from 
                <a class="in-text-link" href='https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/'>Basketball-Reference</a> according to their 
                data usage policies. Moving forward, I will be moving to web scraped data and developing more advanced algorithms 
                that stem from my own accumulation of the data throughout the season, rather than looking at season totals.</p>
